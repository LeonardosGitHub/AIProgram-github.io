### [AI and Emerging Technologies]

- What previous solutions were being used in place of AI? How has AI replaced or will soon replace these solutions?
    - Basic Algorithms and Programming: Before AI many of the items being used relied on algorithms and programming to accomplish tasks. The inputs and outputs were generally known and structred; the outcome was usually known and predictable. For example, a coffee machine typically can be programmed to turn on at a certain time by the user, and keep the coffee warm for a set amount of time. In the future I can imagine where a "smart" coffee maker may make use of various inputs to make a decision on it's own as to when to make the coffee.  For example, it understands the day of the week, knows when the owners alarm is set, can use motion sensors, use cameras, uses historical data, etc. to make a decision on when to brew the coffee. This could potentially be accomplished using programming but AI could be used to account for the differences between peoples schedules and make it more fluid in deciding when to brew the coffee. 
    
- Briefly describe the type of AI being used for this technology (Machine Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, etc.)
    - For the smart coffee maker I believe this would be Machine Learning & Computer Vision.  Using Computer Vision for things like seeing the camera feed, then machine learning to pull together everything and make decisions based on the data at hand.
