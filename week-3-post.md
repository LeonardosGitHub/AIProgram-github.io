### [Machine Learning Model]


- Describe how Teachable Machine uses machine learning to come up with solutions to an arbitrary problem.
    - Teachable Machine allows almost anyone to generate a model based on whatever items they wish. The model takes in input of your desired Classes or objects, it can use a webcam to generate the input, or you can upload pictures of items. You'll want to create more than one class so that the model can train itself on each of the classes desired for the application.  Once you have sufficient classes and video/pictures of each class, you can then train the model.  The model will used supervised learning based on the pictures and come up with a model to identify each of those classes. 
- What application did you choose to create using Teachable Machine?
    - I decided to create a model that would attempt to distinguish between a golf putter and golf wedge. 
- What problem is it intended to solve?
    - No problem was solved, my intent was to understand Teachable Machine and how to create classes, models, and export such models. 
- Why did you choose to create this application?
    - The Golf season is coming up here in central Ohio, so I had my golf clubs handy.  I wanted to see if the model could distinguish between a putter and a wedge.  I imagine the model would have a lot more trouble being able to tell the difference between the various golf irons since they are look very similar and it would be difficult for a webcam to see the differences between the irons.
